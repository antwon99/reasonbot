# Prompt Design for ReasonBot

This doc contains examples, logic trees, and tone templates for ReasonBotâ€™s LLM prompts.

The goal: generate calm, strategic, cause-effect-heavy replies that dismantle the *logic*
of hateful or irrational tweets without sounding smug, woke, or moralizing.

See `/analyzer.py` and `/replier.py` for how these are used in code.
